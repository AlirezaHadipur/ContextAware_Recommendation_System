# Human-Centered Recommendation System

## Background
Recommender systems play a crucial role in personalizing user experiences across various domains, such as e-commerce, streaming services, and content curation. Traditional recommendation techniques often focus on optimizing accuracy, but a human-centered approach considers user needs, transparency, and fairness. This project explores two different approaches to recommendation: **Prefiltering** and **Markov Models**.

## Introduction
This project is part of my university course's final project, where I implemented a recommendation system using two different methodologies:
1. **Prefiltering-based approach** - A technique where irrelevant or unwanted data is filtered out before applying the recommendation model.
2. **Markov Model-based approach** - A probabilistic model that predicts the next user action based on previous interactions.

The goal of this project is to compare these two approaches and analyze their effectiveness in generating relevant recommendations.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For experimentation and visualization
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data processing and manipulation
- **Scikit-learn**: For model evaluation and analysis
- **NetworkX**: For Markov model implementation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization

## What I Learned
- **Understanding of different recommendation approaches**: Gained insights into the advantages and limitations of Prefiltering and Markov Models.
- **Data preprocessing techniques**: Learned how to clean and prepare data for building recommender systems.
- **Model evaluation and comparison**: Explored different metrics to analyze the performance of recommendation algorithms.
- **Implementation of Markov models**: Gained hands-on experience in building transition probability matrices and predicting user behavior.
- **Working with real-world datasets**: Understood challenges in handling sparse and noisy data.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into different recommendation methodologies and their impact on user experience. While Prefiltering helps refine input data, Markov Models offer a probabilistic approach to predicting user behavior. The comparison between these approaches helps in understanding trade-offs in accuracy, efficiency, and computational complexity. Future improvements could include hybrid methods that combine both approaches for better recommendations.
